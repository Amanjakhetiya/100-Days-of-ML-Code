# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
My daily log to track the progress on the 100 days of ML code challenge.

### Day 1 (09-09-18) : Naive Bayes
- Started with the [intro to machine learning](https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120-india)  course on Udacity 
- Learnt the basics of a Naive Bayes classifier on the `iris` dataset
- Working on classifying the `Stanley Terrain` dataset and graph the decision surface

### Day 2 (10-09-18) : Naive Bayes mini-project
- Working on the Naive Bayes mini-project to classify email.
- Tried really hard to make the python 2.7 code compatible with 3.6 and learnt about `dos2unix` and pickling of data. 
- Completed the Naive Bayes project with accuracy of 90.24% (Need to improve it!)

### Day 3 (11-09-18) : SVM and Linear Algebra
- Improved efficiency to 97.869% and completed the mini-project.
- Started the lesson on Support Vector Machines.
- Completed Week 1 of Mathematics for [Machine Learning: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning), a course from Imperial College London on Coursera.

### Day 4 (12-09-18) : SVM and Decision Trees
- Completed the SVM mini-project with 99.08% accuracy using an `rbf` kernel 
- Started the lesson on Decision Trees

### Day 5 (13-09-18) : Decision Trees mini-project
- Working on the Decision tree mini-project
- Referred to 3Blue1Brown's [Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) playlist
