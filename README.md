# 100-Days-of-ML-Code
My daily log to track the progress on the 100 days of ML code challenge.

### Day 1 (09-09-18) : Naive Bayes
- Started with the [intro to machine learning](https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120-india)  course on Udacity 
- Learnt the basics of a Naive Bayes classifier on the `iris` dataset
- Working on classifying the `Stanley Terrain` dataset and graph the decision surface

### Day 2 (10-09-18) : Naive Bayes mini-project
- Working on the Naive Bayes mini-project to classify email.
- Tried really hard to make the python 2.7 code compatible with 3.6 and learnt about `dos2unix` and pickling of data. 
- Completed the Naive Bayes project with accuracy of 90.24% (Need to improve it!)

### Day 3 (11-09-18) : SVM and Linear Algebra
- Improved efficiency to 97.869% and completed the mini-project.
- Started the lesson on Support Vector Machines.
- Completed Week 1 of Mathematics for [Machine Learning: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning), a course from Imperial College London on Coursera.

### Day 4 (12-09-18) : SVM and Decision Trees
- Completed the SVM mini-project with 99.08% accuracy using an `rbf` kernel 
- Started the lesson on Decision Trees

### Day 5 (13-09-18) : Decision Trees mini-project
- Working on the Decision tree mini-project
- Referred to 3Blue1Brown's [Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) playlist

### Day 6 (14-09-18) Decision Tree(Entropy and Information gain) and KNN 
- Completed the Decision Tree mini-project
- Learnt about the K-Nearest Neighbours classifier and implemented the same

### Day 7 (15-09-18) K-Nearest Neighbours
- Implemented the KNN classisier after referring to [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-k-nearest-neighbors-with-scikit-learn-9e4858e231ea) Medium article
- Watched 2 more videos from 3Blue1Brown's [Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) playlist
- Watched Siraj Raval's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&index=1&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU) on classifiers

### Day 8 (16-09-18) RandomForest classifier, Datasets and Questions
- Completed the lesson on datasets and questions to gain key inferences 
- Completed the lesson `WEB 3.0` from Siraj Raval's [Decentralized Applications](https://www.theschool.ai/courses/decentralized-application) course
- Implemented the RandomForest classifier and read up about adaBoost

### Day 9 (17-09-18) Linear and multivariate Regression
- Completed the lesson on Regressions and implemented the same in the mini-project
- Working on the lesson on outliers in datasets
