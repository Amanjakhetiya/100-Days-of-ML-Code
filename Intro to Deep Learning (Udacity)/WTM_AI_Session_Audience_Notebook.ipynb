However, Text Classification problems are not only limited to such cases, and we can have classification problems that can have multiple target candidates (more than 2). For example, consider the following cases: \n",
        "\n",
        "* Classifying customer queries into topic categories \n",
        "* Classifying tweets about the weather by time, sentiment, and kind\n",

        "For the purpose of this hands-on session, we will look at classifying movie reviews into \"positive\" reviews and \"negative\" reviews, just based on the text content of the reviews. While this problem is fairly simple, it is a good starting point to understand the stages of development of an AI Solution, and the techniques we use are transferrable to a whole range of domains and problems. \n",

        "Lets train a simple neural network for our IMDB Dataset and use an embedding layer that first transforms our word sequences into word vectors.\n",

        "There are two ways to obtain word embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Learn word embeddings jointly with the main task you care about (e.g. document classification or sentiment prediction). In this setup, you would start with random word vectors, then learn your word vectors in the same way that you learn the weights of a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Load into your model word embeddings that were pre-computed using a different machine learning task than the one you are trying to solve. These are called \"pre-trained word embeddings\".\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll first go with our first approach by learning the embeddings using the `Embedding` layer from `keras`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Embedding` layer is best understood as a dictionary mapping integer indices (which stand for specific words) to dense vectors. It takes \n",
        "as input integers, it looks up these integers into an internal dictionary, and it returns the associated vectors. It's effectively a dictionary lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Embedding layer takes as input a 2D tensor of integers, of shape (samples, sequence_length), where each entry is a sequence of integers. It can embed sequences of variable lengths, so for instance we could feed into our embedding layer above batches that could have shapes (32, 10) (batch of 32 sequences of length 10) or (64, 15) (batch of 64 sequences of length 15). All sequences in a batch must have the same length, though (since we need to pack them into a single tensor), so sequences that are shorter than others should be padded with zeros, and sequences that are longer should be truncated.\n",
        "\n",
        "This layer returns a 3D floating point tensor, of shape (samples, sequence_length, embedding_dimensionality). Such a 3D tensor can then be processed by a RNN layer or a 1D convolution layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you instantiate an Embedding layer, its weights (its internal dictionary of token vectors) are initially random, just like with any other layer. During training, these word vectors will be gradually adjusted via backpropagation, structuring the space into something that the downstream model can exploit. Once fully trained, your embedding space will show a lot of structure -- a kind of structure specialized for the specific problem you were training your model for."
